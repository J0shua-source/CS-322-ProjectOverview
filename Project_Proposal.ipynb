    "# Algorithm Project Proposal  \n",
    "**Team C.J.: Chris Wong and Joshua Meyer**  \n",
    "**CPSC 322, Fall 2025**\n",

    "## 1. Project Title\n",
    "**Predicting Bitcoin Price Movement Using Treasury and Sentiment Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Dataset Description\n",
    "- **Source:** [Kaggle — Bitcoin and US Treasury with Daily Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessearzate/bitcoin-and-us-treasury-with-daily-sentiment?select=bitcoin_sentiment_12012022_11082025.csv)  \n",
    "- **Format:** CSV file  \n",
    "- **Contents:**  \n",
    "  - Daily Bitcoin trading data (open, close, high, low, volume)  \n",
    "  - US Treasury data (bonds, bills, notes)  \n",
    "  - Market sentiment scores (weighted sentiment, daily sentiment indicators)  \n",
    "- **Time Range:** December 1, 2022 – November 2025  \n",
    "- **Size:** ~1,000 daily instances, 26 attributes  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Attributes and Target\n",
    "We plan to use the following attributes as predictors:  \n",
    "- **Bitcoin metrics:** open, high, low, volume  \n",
    "- **Treasury data:** treasury_bonds, treasury_bills, treasury_notes  \n",
    "- **Sentiment data:** market sentiment, weighted_sentiment  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Target (Class Information)\n",
    "- Instead of predicting the raw **close** value (regression), we will **discretize close into categories** for classification:  \n",
    "  - **Binary classification:** “Up” if close > previous day’s close, “Down” otherwise.  \n",
    "  - **Alternative:** Discretize into three bins (Low / Medium / High) using quantiles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Implementation / Technical Merit\n",
    "- **Preprocessing:**  \n",
    "  - Handle missing sentiment values (drop or impute).  \n",
    "  - Normalize/standardize numeric features.  \n",
    "  - Discretize continuous target into categorical classes.  \n",
    "- **Feature Selection:**  \n",
    "  - Correlation pruning to remove redundant attributes.  \n",
    "  - Embedded importance from decision trees and random forest.  \n",
    "  - PCA (optional) for dimensionality reduction if collinearity is high.  \n",
    "- **Classifiers:**  \n",
    "  - **Decision Tree (baseline)**  \n",
    "  - **MyRandomForestClassifier (custom implementation)**  \n",
    "  - **XGBoost (advanced ensemble)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Anticipated Challenges\n",
    "- **Missing values:** Some sentiment data may be incomplete.  \n",
    "- **Class imbalance:** Bitcoin price may rise more often than fall, requiring stratified sampling or weighted metrics.  \n",
    "- **Temporal dependency:** Daily data has sequential structure; we will treat each day independently for classification.  \n",
    "- **Bias in feature selection:** Choosing only 10 attributes may introduce bias; PCA and embedded methods will help mitigate this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Feature Selection Techniques\n",
    "- **Filter methods:** Correlation heatmaps, variance thresholds.  \n",
    "- **Embedded methods:** Feature importance from decision trees and XGBoost.  \n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction:** PCA to reduce noise and speed up training, with trade-off in interpretability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Potential Impact of Results\n",
    "- **Usefulness:**  \n",
    "  - Predicting Bitcoin price movement categories can help investors and institutions anticipate market trends.  \n",
    "  - Provides a framework for testing hypotheses about the relationship between treasury yields, sentiment, and crypto markets.  \n",
    "- **Stakeholders:**  \n",
    "  - Hedge funds, banks, and trading firms focusing on Bitcoin strategies.  \n",
    "  - Retail investors and Bitcoin holders.  \n",
    "  - Shareholders in financial institutions exposed to crypto markets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Citations\n",
    "- **Dataset:** Kaggle — Bitcoin and US Treasury with Daily Sentiment  \n",
    "- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  \n",
    "- **References:**  \n",
    "  - Scikit-learn documentation (Decision Trees, PCA)  \n",
    "  - XGBoost documentation  \n",
    "  - Course-provided materials for Random Forest implementation  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Next Steps\n",
    "- Finalize discretization strategy for the target variable (“close”).  \n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize distributions, correlations, and class balance.  \n",
    "- Implement and evaluate classifiers, beginning with the custom `MyRandomForestClassifier`.  \n",
    "- Compare performance across classifiers and report best results with confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.  \n",
