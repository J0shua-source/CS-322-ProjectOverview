    "## 4. Implementation / Technical Merit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing Pipeline\n",
    "1. **Data Loading:** CSV parsing with proper encoding (UTF-8) and handling of categorical data\n",
    "2. **Feature Encoding:** One-Hot Encoding using scikit-learn's `OneHotEncoder` to convert categorical features into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms\n",
    "3. **Data Splitting:** Stratified train-test split (2/3 training, 1/3 testing) with `random_state=9` for reproducibility across all algorithms\n",
    "4. **Handling Unknown Categories:** OneHotEncoder configured with `handle_unknown=\"ignore\"` to gracefully handle unseen categorical values during prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Algorithms\n",
    "We will implement and compare three distinct classification approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Tree Classifier (Baseline)**\n",
    "   - Implementation: scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier`\n",
    "   - Hyperparameters: Gini impurity criterion, max_depth=10, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1\n",
    "   - Rationale: Provides interpretable baseline with decision rules that can be visualized\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forest Classifier (Custom Implementation)**\n",
    "   - Implementation: Custom `MyRandomForestClassifier` from course materials\n",

    "   - Rationale: Instance-based learning approach that captures local patterns in the discretized feature space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Methodology\n",

    "- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and classification reports\n",
    "- **Comparison Framework:** Direct comparison of model performance on identical test data to assess relative effectiveness\n",

    "- **Reproducibility:** Fixed random seeds ensure consistent results across algorithm comparisons\n",
    "- **Code Organization:** Modular design with separate demo scripts for each classifier, facilitating independent evaluation and comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Anticipated Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing Challenges\n",
    "1. **Categorical Feature Encoding:** With 19 categorical features, one-hot encoding will create a high-dimensional feature space. This may lead to:\n",
    "   - Increased computational complexity\n",
    "   - Potential overfitting with limited training data\n",
    "   - Sparse feature matrices requiring efficient memory management\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Distribution:** Binary classification may exhibit class imbalance if Bitcoin price movements are not evenly distributed between \"Up\" and \"Down\" classes. Mitigation strategies include:\n",
    "   - Stratified sampling in train-test splits (already implemented)\n",
    "   - Class weight balancing in algorithms that support it\n",
    "   - Evaluation metrics that account for imbalance (precision, recall, F1-score)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Dependencies:** Daily financial data contains inherent temporal structure, but we treat each day independently. This approach:\n",
    "   - Ignores potential autocorrelation in price movements\n",
    "   - May miss sequential patterns that could improve prediction\n",
    "   - Simplifies the problem but may limit model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Challenges\n",
    "1. **High Dimensionality:** After one-hot encoding, the feature space expands significantly, potentially leading to:\n",
    "   - Curse of dimensionality effects, especially for KNN\n",
    "   - Increased risk of overfitting in decision trees\n",
    "   - Need for regularization or feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Discretization Information Loss:** Converting continuous treasury and sentiment values to categorical bins may:\n",
    "   - Lose fine-grained information that could be predictive\n",
    "   - Introduce discretization bias depending on bin boundaries\n",
    "   - Reduce model sensitivity to subtle feature variations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Interpretability vs. Performance Trade-off:**\n",
    "   - Decision trees offer high interpretability but may underperform\n",
    "   - Random forests improve performance but reduce interpretability\n",
    "   - KNN provides no explicit feature importance insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection Considerations\n",
    "With 19 original features (expanding to many more after one-hot encoding), we will:\n",
    "- **Monitor Feature Importance:** Use embedded methods (decision tree feature importance, random forest feature importance) to identify most predictive features\n",
    "- **Evaluate Feature Redundancy:** Analyze correlation between discretized features to identify potential redundancies\n",
    "- **Consider Dimensionality Reduction:** If needed, explore PCA or feature selection techniques, though this may reduce interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Feature Selection Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the discretized categorical nature of our dataset and the expansion of features through one-hot encoding, we will employ the following feature selection strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedded Methods (Primary Approach)\n",
    "1. **Decision Tree Feature Importance:** \n",
    "   - Extract feature importance scores from trained decision trees\n",
    "   - Identify features that contribute most to classification decisions\n",
    "   - Visualize feature importance rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forest Feature Importance:**\n",
    "   - Aggregate feature importance across multiple trees in the forest\n",
    "   - More robust than single-tree importance due to ensemble averaging\n",
    "   - Identify features consistently important across bootstrap samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter Methods (Secondary Analysis)\n",
    "1. **Correlation Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Examine correlations between one-hot encoded features and target variable\n",
    "   - Identify features with strong predictive relationships\n",
    "   - Note: Limited utility with categorical data, but can reveal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Distribution Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Analyze how feature value distributions differ between \"Up\" and \"Down\" classes\n",
    "   - Identify features with distinct distributions across classes\n",
    "   - Use chi-square tests or similar statistical measures for categorical features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Considerations\n",
    "- **Current Approach:** Use all features with one-hot encoding to preserve information\n",
    "- **Future Consideration:** If model performance is poor or overfitting occurs, we may:\n",
    "  - Select top-k features based on importance scores\n",
    "  - Use recursive feature elimination\n",
    "  - Apply PCA (though this reduces interpretability with categorical data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "- Compare model performance with full feature set vs. reduced feature sets\n",
    "- Balance between model complexity and performance\n",
    "- Maintain interpretability where possible, especially for decision trees\n",
    "\n",
